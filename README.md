# Week Project 2 - Yelp

Yelp app is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 25 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [x] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

## Notes

   Currently, I'm complete the functions sort by distance, but I can't hold value in the first filter by distance when i click to Filters button in the next time.
